					Online banking allows a user to conduct financial transactions via the Internet. Online banking is also known as Internet banking or web banking.
					Online banking offers customers almost every service traditionally available through a local branch including deposits, transfers, and online bill payments.<br>
					Consumers aren't required to visit a bank branch in order to complete most of their basic banking transactions. </p>
